            initialValue: "pending",
        }
    ]
};
export default order;
```

## ðŸ”—Third-Party APIs
* **Shipment Tracking API :** Fetches real-time shipment updates.
* **Payment Gateway :** Integrates with providers like Stripe.
* **Product Data API :**
  - **Endpoint :** ``/products``
  - **Method :** ``/Get``
  - **Response Example :** 
```
[
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Product A",
      "price": 100,
      "stock": 50
    }
] 
```

## ðŸ”— System Architecture
* **Frontend (Next.js) :** Handles the user interface
* **Sanity CMS :** Manages product and order data.
* **APIs :** Product Data API, Order Data API, and third-party integrations (e.g., Stripe, Shipment Tracking).
